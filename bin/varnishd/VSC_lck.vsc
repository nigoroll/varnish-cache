	This is *NOT* a RST file but the syntax has been chosen so
	that it may become an RST file at some later date.

.. varnish_vsc_begin::	lck
	:oneliner:	Lock Counters
	:order:		70

	Counters which track the activity in the different classes
	of mutex-locks.

	The counts may be slightly wrong if there are more than one
	lock instantiated in each class (ie: .creat > 1)

.. varnish_vsc:: creat
	:type:	counter
	:level:	debug
	:oneliner:	Created locks


.. varnish_vsc:: destroy
	:type:	counter
	:level:	debug
	:oneliner:	Destroyed locks


.. varnish_vsc:: locks
	:type:	counter
	:level:	debug
	:oneliner:	Lock Operations


.. varnish_vsc:: busy
	:type:	counter
	:level:	debug
	:oneliner:	Contended locks

	For trylock operations, counts the number of EBUSY returns.

	If the LCK debug bit is enabled, all lock operations are
	changed to issue a trylock first to report contended locks.

.. varnish_vsc_end::	lck
