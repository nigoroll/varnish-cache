Policy and Governance of the Varnish Cache Project
--------------------------------------------------

The Varnish Governance Board (VGB) was originally created to mitigate
a low Truck Factor and resolve conflicts, but has been inactive for
several years.

The VGB will be set up again, with members who are currently active in
the project.
Responsibilities of the board include setting up rules
for the project, and resolving any conflicts that may turn up.

Until the VGB has been formed, code maintainers will be elected at the
VDD (Varnish Developer Day).
As of now, there are three maintainer "hats", held by

* Poul-Henning Kamp
* Varnish Software
* UPLEX

Here the companies will nominate the developer who is considered its
VC maintainer, and this can vary throughout the year (to allow for
vacations etc.).

The members of the VGB is elected during the VDD, but this will
typically happen through by acclamation. We prefer the members to have
enough distance and neutrality to be able to resolve conflicts, should
it ever become necessary.

The Varnish Developer day has, so far, been by invitation, where all
core developers and some big users of Varnish, have been invited. We
are looking to expand this so that Varnish users can take a bigger
part, and have a bigger influence on the direction of Varnish
Cache. At the same time, we will keep some time that is purely for
developers, where the most technical aspects of Varnish and its
implementation is discussed.
