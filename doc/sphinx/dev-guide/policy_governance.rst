Policy and Governance of the Varnish Cache Project
--------------------------------------------------

The Varnish Governance Board (VGB) was originally nominated to
formally govern the project in order to mitigate a low Truck Factor
and resolve conflicts, but has been inactive for several years.

The VGB will be set up again, with members who are currently active in
the project. As of September 2019, Martin Blix Grydeland (Varnish
Software) and Nils Goroll (UPLEX) have been tasked by the participants
of the Varnish Developer Day (VDD) with working out a suggestion for
bootstrapping the process to transfer the Varnish Cache project to an
independent legal entity in the form of a Verein / Forening /
Foundation. This entity would then elect a new VGB, which should have
enough distance and neutrality to be able to resolve conflicts, should
it ever become necessary.

.. _policy-maintainers:

Maintainer Roles
----------------

Regarding the day-to-day development of Varnish-Cache, decisions are
made by project maintainers on:

* disputed pull requests
* VIPs
* which contributors should be granted the commit bit
* and all other relevant decisions regarding the design of Varnish Cache

For disputes amongst them, maintainers decide by a 2/3 majority.

Maintainers are being nominated by VDD participants by majority
decision, and are to be approved by the VGB, once it is installed.

As of September 2019, three maintainer "hats" have been nominated,
held by

* Firma den Andensidste Viking (Poul-Henning Kamp)
* Varnish Software
* UPLEX

The companies will nominate a developer as their maintainer, and this
can vary throughout the year (to allow for vacations etc.).

The Varnish Developer Day
-------------------------

The Varnish Developer Day (VDD) has, in recent years, been by
invitation only, and traditionally, core developers and relevant
supporters of the project participated. The exact rules for future
Developer Days are still to be worked out, but the project will
continue to invite all developers who have made meaningful
contributions. The purpose of the VDD will remain to provide a
platform for discussion of technical aspects of Varnish and its
implementation.

We are also looking to bring back Varnish User Group (VUG) meetings
before or after VDDs so that Varnish users can take a bigger part in,
and have a bigger influence on the direction of Varnish Cache.
